To build the Power Supply Board complete the following steps:

1. Submit the Power Supply Final PCB files.zip to a board manufacturer of your choice. We used https://oshpark.com/ to fabricate ours.
2. Order the Components listed in Power Supply Final BOM.xlsx
3. Apply solder paste to all smd pads.
4. Carefully place smd components on their pads according to the BOM, schematic, and pcb layout.
5. Use a hot air gun to solder all smd components.
6. Check for solder bridges, especially on the switching voltage regulator and current limiting switch ICs.
7. Use a DMM to verify that there is no short between any of the outputs and ground.
8. Using a Soldering Iron and solder, solder all through hole components.
9. MAKE SURE THE TRANSFORMER DOT IS FACING THE SUPERCAPACITORS AND ICS. (the dot denotes the secondary side, the primary side should be connected to wall power)
10. Be careful when applying wall power to circuitry for the first time.

The Power Supply PCB has the following connections:
3.3V (Right Center): -> 3.3V input of Control Board PCB
GND (Right Center): -> 3.3V ground input of Control Board PCB
5V (1) (Bottom Right): -> 5V input of Control Board PCB
GND (1) (Bottom Right): -> 5V ground input of Control PCB
5V (2) (Bottom Right): -> 5V input of OpenMV Cam
GND (2) (Bottom Right): -> 5V ground input of OpenMV Cam
5V Strobe (Top Right): -> 5V input of Strobe Light PCB
GND (Top Right): -> 5V ground input of Strobe Light PCB

Note: When power is initially applied, the supercapactors will take time to charge. Expect the 5V strobe output to rise to 5V slowly over the course of several minutes.
Note: The supercapacitors keep the outputs alive after wall power is disconnected. Circuitry will function until they are discharged.

To build the Control Board complete the following steps:

1. Submit the Control Board Final PCB v2.zip to a board manufacturer of your choice. We used https://oshpark.com/ to fabricate ours.
2. Order the Components listed in Control Board BOM.xlsx
3. Apply solder paste to all smd pads.
4. Carefully place smd components on their pads according to the BOM, schematic, and pcb layout.
5. Use a hot air gun to solder all smd components.
6. Check for and remove solder bridges.
7. Using a Soldering Iron and solder, solder all through hole components.

The Power Supply PCB has the following connections:
3V3 (bottom right): -> 3.3V output of Power Supply PCB
G (bottom right): -> 3.3V Ground output of Power Supply PCB
Strobe (bottom right): -> Gate signal input of Strobe Light PCB
Audio2 (Top Right): -> Input signal for Speaker
Audio G (Top Right): -> Ground for Speaker
5V (Top Middle): -> 5V output of Power Supply PCB
G (Top Middle): -> 5V Ground output of Power Supply PCB
SCL (Top Left of Center): -> I2C SCL pin of OpenMV Cam
SDA (Top Left of Center): -> I2C SDA pin of OpenMV Cam

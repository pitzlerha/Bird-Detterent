To build the prototype, complete the following steps:
1. Order all four PCBs. The design zip files can be found in PCB_Files. We recommend submitting these files to a board manufacturer such as OSH Park for manufacturing.
2. Order all relevant components. The components needed for each board can be found in BOM files located in PCB_Files. Alternatively you can consult the Master BOM in this folder.
3. Order the ESP32-S2-DevKitM-1R and Open MV Cam H7 Plus.
4. Follow the Instructions in the Microcontroller Code and Open MV Cam subfolders to flash the appropriate binaries onto the microcontrollers.
4. Use a 3D Printer to print the enclosure Pieces.
5. Follow the instructions in the Enclosure sub-folder to assemble the enclosure
6. Follow the board assembly notes contained in the ReadMes for each board. (Located as subfolders of this folder)
7. Directly connect the motion detector and ESP32 Dev board to the Control Board. (Male to female pin Header Connections).
8. Mount all of the Boards as directed in teh assembly notes contained in the Enclosure sub-folder.
9. Use Jumper pins to connect the boards as follows:

Power Supply 3.3V: -> 3.3V input of Control Board PCB
Power Supply GND: -> 3.3V ground input of Control Board PCB
Power Supply 5V (1): -> 5V input of Control Board PCB
Power Supply GND (1): -> 5V ground input of Control PCB
Power Supply 5V (2): -> 5V input of OpenMV Cam
Power Supply GND (2): -> 5V ground input of OpenMV Cam
Power Supply 5V Strobe: -> 5V input of Strobe Light PCB
Power Supply GND: -> 5V ground input of Strobe Light PCB
Control Board Strobe (bottom right): -> Gate signal input of Strobe Light PCB
Control Board Audio2 (Top Right): -> Input signal for Speaker
Control Board Audio G (Top Right): -> Ground for Speaker
Control Board SCL (Top Left of Center): -> I2C SCL pin of OpenMV Cam
Control Board SDA (Top Left of Center): -> I2C SDA pin of OpenMV Cam

Follow instructions in the Enclosure sub-folder to Weather Proof the Enclosure.
